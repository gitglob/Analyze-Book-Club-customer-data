What **dataset** did we have? 
* A dataset with information about the book club's customers, including the important R, F, M variables.

What was our **task**?
* To use certain techniques, in order to :

  5. Check the accuracy of our predictions.
    
What **type of problem** was it?
* It was a preprocessing heavy, classification problem, with some tasks that required regression for comparison of the results.
    
What **techniques** did we use?
  1. RFM segmentation
  2. KNN classification, KNN regression, Logistic Regression  
  
  
Important to **note**:
* The main difficulty and importance of the project was understanding the data and their economic value, especially as part
of a company's marketing plan, and how we can fully take advantage of them.
